PHP E-commerce System (Onlinestore)


This is a portable PHP front-end e-commerce system. The solution can run on any PHP server without the need of any configuration or Database setup. It connects to a remote database (blindly) through a robust XML-Webservice.
The solution provides the flexibility for upgrading, customizing, scaling, and styling (skinning).
